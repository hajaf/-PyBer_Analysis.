As can be observed above The city type with the highest fares from January to May is Urban with the highest amount being $2500 with in February and March and the lowest in the beginning of January more than $1500.While that might be The Urban city types lowest amount it is still higher than the Suburbanâ€™s highest fares which was with in the month of March  a little less than $1500.The lowest Fare for the Suburban city types (<$1000)is higher  than the city type with the lowest fare Rural which has a max fare of $500 in April 

<h2>Summary </h2>

The disparities among the city types is most likely due to population since Urban city types generally have a higher population than Suburban city types which have a higher population than rural cities. I would then suggest investing more resources to adversities in rural and suburban city types than Urban city types because its easier to find riders in highly populated areas and word of travels faster in more densely populated areas. I would also suggest trying to bring down the cost of rides in rural cities to encourage more consumers in to use PyBer and increase total fares. Lastly, I would increase the price of Urban city types of fares
